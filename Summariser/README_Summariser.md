# DSA4213-Summariser-Grp30
This folder contains the following:
- Experimental fine-tuned models for each component of the Summariser Model
- Jupyter notebooks used for training, evaluation and debugging of code
- Grp30_Summariser.py script to test run an interactive short story summariser

### If you want to reproduce the evaluation results (skip the training/fine-tuning cells as instructed within each notebook), ensure that you have followed the instructions in the main folder's README. 

### Otherwise, to test the summariser model alone
Ensure you are in this folder directory on your terminal, then execute the script with:
```shell
python Grp30_Summariser.py
```
